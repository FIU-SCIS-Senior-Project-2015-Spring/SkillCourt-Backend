                        SkillCourt presents its patent pending game, an interactive system 
                        consisting of a software application and illuminated target pads called 
                        illumipad. The shockproof surface on each individual illumipad has the 
                        ability to completely light up to represent a target for users to hit with 
                        a Soccer ball. When a ball hits the surface of particular target the 
                        illumipads interior touch &amp; pressure sensors immediately reports back 
                        to app for live feedback. Via app, the illumipads communicate wirelessly 
                        through Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to initiate different training exercises where 
                        user performance is documented and statistics reported. The pads provide 
                        a multiple color illuminations to guide the user for a particular game, 
                        the more pads the more targets user can play with.</p>
