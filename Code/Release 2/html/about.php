<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p id="introductionParagraph" class="aboutUsParagraph">SkillCourt presents its patent pending game, an interactive system consisting of a software application

and illuminated target pads called illumipad. The shockproof surface on each individual illumipad has

the ability to completely light up to represent a target for users to hit with a Soccer ball. When a ball hits

the surface of particular target the illumipads interior touch & pressure sensors immediately reports

back to app for live feedback. Via app, the illumipads communicate wirelessly through Bluetooth or Wi-

Fi to initiate different training exercises where user performance is documented and statistics reported.

The pads provide a multiple color illuminations to guide the user for a particular game, the more pads

the more targets user can play with.</p>

<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p id="challengeParagraph" class="aboutUsParagraph">Soccer players at all ages lack the exposure to efficient commercialized Soccer technology. Every player

who wants to improve would for example love to receive any measurable statistics about their

individual performance. Also, there hasn’t been a lot of breakthrough technological advancements in

products for Soccer players to use when practicing individually outside of practice hours. Combine that

with the ongoing neuroscientific research by leading experts in sports which emphasizes the importance

on the athlete’s brain power (i.e. cognitive skills). Neuroscience suggests that brain powering activities

plays a huge role when players prepare physically & mentally for those key moments during games to

execute a move at the right time with the desired motor skill. All Soccer enthusiasts know that with each

move on the field could have a domino effect on good things or bad to come.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p id="solutionParagraph">SkillCourt is developing a concept that provides to the Soccer public a game that captures statistical

metrics, always incorporates a ball for any activities, has any level of physical difficulty but at the same

time is always geared to improve the user’s cognitive skills. The game is considered for the individual

although two or more players could play versions of games fitting to the particular number of users. The

patent pending combination of the software & hardware sets up capabilities of endless variations

starting off with one pad only. The goal is to help all soccer players, clubs, organizations, families, and

businesses with a tool that brings the users closer to their true physical & mental potential playing the

game of Soccer. The pads can be laid out, mounted, or installed in places where space and the proper

surface allows. The focus is to have a user friendly app as a personal guide for the user and technology

where the illumipad’s aesthetic charms is presented through its lightness, durability and overall outlook

design.</p>
